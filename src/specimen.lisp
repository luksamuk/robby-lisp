(in-package #:robby)

;;; A specimen is essentially a vector, a sequence of exactly 243 actions
;;; describing what Robby should do for each situation on the board.
;;;
;;; These situations relate to Robby's current view of the board. Robby uses
;;; a vision based on Moore's neighborhood, where it looks at four cardinal
;;; directions (North, South, East, West) and to wherever it is.
;;;
;;; Every time Robby looks at its neighborhood, the state of the five observed
;;; cells can be:
;;; 1. A wall (except for the center one);
;;; 2. Empty;
;;; 3. Contains a can.
;;;
;;; For each single neighborhood vision containing the state of the five
;;; observed cells, Robby performs the action ascribed to it. The actions are
;;; enumerated in *VALID-MOVES*, and are basically actions for walking on all
;;; four directions, plus the actions for picking up a can on the current
;;; location, staying put, and selecting an action at random.

  "Generate a raw random specimen.
A raw specimen is a vector of random strategies. The number of strategies
is always 243, which is the max value of a trinary number of five digits.
This is determined by the facts that Robby can only look at its Moore
neighborhood including where it is (north, south, east, west, here) and
that a place on the board can have three states (empty, wall, can)."
